# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

DocForge-ai takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Code Security
- **No automatic merging** - All changes require manual approval from @Venkatesh188
- **Branch protection** - Main and develop branches are protected
- **Code review required** - All code changes must be reviewed
- **Security scanning** - Automated security checks on every commit
- **Dependency monitoring** - Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### CI/CD Security
- **Manual approval workflows** - No automated deployments
- **Secret management** - API keys stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- **Environment isolation** - Separate environments for testing and production
- **Artifact verification** - All packages are verified before publishing

### Access Control
- **Code ownership** - Only @Venkatesh188 can approve changes
- **Repository permissions** - Restricted access to sensitive operations
- **API key protection** - OpenAI API keys are not stored in code
- **Environment variables** - Sensitive data stored in .env files

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email security details to: security@docforge.dev
4. **DO** include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** - We'll investigate within 48 hours
3. **Fix Development** - We'll develop a fix as quickly as possible
4. **Release** - We'll release a security update
5. **Disclosure** - We'll publicly disclose after the fix is available

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Scans
Our CI/CD pipeline includes multiple security scanning tools:

- **Safety** - Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit** - Python security linting
- **Semgrep** - Static analysis security testing
- **CodeQL** - GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates

### Manual Reviews
- All code changes are manually reviewed by @Venkatesh188
- Security-sensitive changes receive extra scrutiny
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Periodic penetration testing (planned)

## üîê API Key Security

### OpenAI API Keys
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for API key storage
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security
- **Monitor usage** for suspicious activity

### Best Practices
```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct - Use environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# ‚ùå Wrong - Never hardcode in source
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."  # DON'T DO THIS
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict pushes to protected branches
- Require conversation resolution

### Repository Settings
- Disable force pushes
- Enable branch protection
- Require signed commits (optional)
- Enable vulnerability alerts
- Enable security advisories
