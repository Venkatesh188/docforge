# üîí Security Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the security measures for your DocForge-ai repository to ensure only you can approve and merge changes.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Enable Branch Protection Rules

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** for the `main` branch
4. Configure the following settings:

#### Main Branch Protection:
```
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚úÖ Require review from code owners

‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes to matching branches

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ‚úÖ Required status checks:
    - Test Suite
    - Security Scan
    - Package Test
    - Docker Build Test

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging

‚úÖ Include administrators
```

5. Click **Create** to save the rule

#### Develop Branch Protection:
Repeat the same process for the `develop` branch with these settings:
```
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed

‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files
  ‚úÖ Restrict pushes to matching branches

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ‚úÖ Required status checks:
    - Quick Check
    - Test Suite

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging

‚úÖ Include administrators
```

### 2. Set Up Code Owners

The `.github/CODEOWNERS` file is already created and configured to require your approval for all changes.

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. Scroll down to **Danger Zone**
3. Ensure these settings are configured:

```
‚úÖ Allow merge commits
‚úÖ Allow squash merging
‚úÖ Allow rebase merging
‚ùå Allow auto-merge (DISABLED)
```

### 4. Set Up Secrets

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Add the following secrets:

#### Required Secrets:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - Your PyPI API token for publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub

#### Optional Secrets:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For testing (if you want to test with real API)

### 5. Enable Security Features

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Security**
2. Enable these features:

```
‚úÖ Dependency graph
‚úÖ Dependabot alerts
‚úÖ Dependabot security updates
‚úÖ Code scanning alerts
‚úÖ Secret scanning
```

### 6. Configure Dependabot

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Security** ‚Üí **Code security and analysis**
2. Enable **Dependabot alerts**
3. Enable **Dependabot security updates**

## üîç Verification

### Test Branch Protection

1. Create a test branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-branch-protection
   ```

2. Make a small change and commit:
   ```bash
   echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
   git add TEST.md
   git commit -m "test: add test file"
   git push origin test-branch-protection
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request to `main`
4. Verify that:
   - ‚úÖ You cannot merge without approval
   - ‚úÖ Status checks are required
   - ‚úÖ You need to approve the PR yourself

### Test Dependabot

1. The Dependabot configuration will automatically create PRs for dependency updates
2. Verify that these PRs:
   - ‚úÖ Require manual approval
   - ‚úÖ Have "needs-review" label
   - ‚úÖ Cannot be auto-merged

### Test Security Scanning

1. Push a commit to trigger the CI pipeline
2. Verify that security scans run:
   - ‚úÖ Safety check
   - ‚úÖ Bandit security check
   - ‚úÖ Semgrep scan
   - ‚úÖ CodeQL analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Override Process

If you need to override branch protection:

### For Emergency Situations:
1. Go to the PR page
2. Click **Merge** button
3. Select **Override branch protection**
4. Add a comment explaining why override was needed
5. Confirm the override

### For Dependabot PRs:
1. Use the manual approval workflow
2. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Manual Approval Required**
3. Run the workflow with appropriate parameters

## üìã Security Checklist

### Initial Setup:
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled for `main` and `develop`
